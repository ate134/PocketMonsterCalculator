# Pocket Monster Calculator
This personal project was made for people who do not have the Pokemon type attack and defense
buffs/debuffs memorized. This version is currently only valid for Gen 6 only (Sun and Moon).

	
## How To Use:
- **Basic Operation:**
	- Click on the type buttons in top to change the current type stats seen. 
	![Type Buttons](https://github.com/ate134/PocketMonsterCalculator/blob/master/Assets/Materials/Pictures%20for%20GitHub/Types.PNG "Type Buttons")
	- To swap between seeing the offensive and defensive stats, click on the
	Offensive/Defensive button.

- **Dual Mode:**
	- To enable/disable the dual mode feature, click the box beside the "Dual Mode" text.

	- If dual mode is enabled when you click on a type, its type name will be added below the 
	"Dual Mode" text

## ToDo:
- Add option for previous generations
- Better UI
- Add good way for testing against 2 types *(Grass+Water vs Ice+Bug)*
