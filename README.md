# Pocket Monster Calculator
This personal project was made for people who do not have the Pokemon type attack and defense
buffs/debuffs memorized. This version is currently only valid for Gen 6 only (Sun and Moon).

	
## How To Use:
- **Basic Operation:**
	- Click on the type buttons in top to change the current type stats seen.
	- To swap between seeing the offensive and defensive stats, click on the
	Offensive/Defensive button.
	
- **Dual Mode:**
	- To enable/disable the dual mode feature, click the box beside the "Dual Mode" text.
	- If dual mode is enabled when you click on a type, its type name will be added below the 
	"Dual Mode" text
